BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK
Benefitting from AI-powered enhancements to our advertising platform, higher engagement in Video Accounts, and growth
in our evergreen games, we achieved double digit revenue growth while sustaining continued operating leverage in the fourth
quarter of 2024. Starting a few months ago, we have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation
and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for
our AI-native products. We believe these stepped-up investments will generate ongoing returns via uplifting productivity in
our advertising business and longevity of our games, as well as longer term value from accelerated consumer usage of our AI
applications and enterprise adoption of our AI services.
Annual Report 2024 5
Chairman’s Statement
Below are some highlights from our key products and services for 2024:
‧ Weixin strengthened its user engagement and transaction capabilities through the launch of Mini Shops, our platform for
indexed and standardised merchandise.
‧ Video Accounts’ total user time spent grew rapidly year-on-year, benefitting from enhanced recommendation algorithms
and more local content.
‧ Query volume rapidly increased in Weixin Search, benefitting from integrating AI capabilities which enhance the
relevance and quality of search results.
‧ Tencent Video maintained its leading position in China’s long-form video market with 113 million1
 video subscribers.
Tencent Music extended its industry leadership in China’s music streaming market with 121 million2
 music subscribers.
‧ We expanded our evergreen games portfolio3
 from 12 games in 2023 to 14 in 2024, while nurturing new games with
evergreen potential.
‧ We upgraded our advertising technology platform by optimising advertisement ranking systems and adding LLM
capabilities, driving higher click-through rates and advertiser spending.
‧ For FinTech services, we upgraded our risk controls and optimised payment funding costs.
‧ We rapidly iterated our HunYuan Foundation Model, deployed AI for internal use cases, and prepared for breakout
growth in consumer adoption of AI, via the Yuanbao and Weixin applications.
We delivered substantial shareholder returns in 2024 through payment of a cash dividend of HKD3.40 per share (equivalent
to approximately HKD32 billion) and through share repurchase of approximately HKD112 billion. For 2025, we propose to
increase our annual dividend by 32%, to HKD4.50 per share4
 (equivalent to approximately HKD41 billion), and we intend to
repurchase at least HKD80 billion worth of our shares.

– Revenues from VAS increased by 7% year-on-year to RMB319.2 billion for the year ended 31 December 2024.
International Games revenues were RMB58.0 billion, reflecting 9% growth in both reported and constant currency
terms, driven by strong performances from PUBG MOBILE and Supercell’s games. Domestic Games revenues rose by
10% to RMB139.7 billion, driven by revenue growth from VALORANT, Naruto Mobile, Fight of the Golden Spatula and
League of Legends: Wild Rift, alongside new contributions from DnF Mobile and Delta Force. Social Networks revenues
were RMB121.5 billion, up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher revenues from music and long-form video subscription
services, increased app-based game virtual item sales and Mini Games platform service fees, partially offset by a decline
in music-related and games-related live streaming revenues.
– Revenues from Marketing Services increased by 20% year-on-year to RMB121.4 billion for the year ended
31 December 2024. This increase was primarily due to robust advertiser demand for Video Accounts, Mini Programs
and Weixin Search inventories, and ongoing enhancement of our AI-powered advertising infrastructure. Advertising
spending rose across most major categories, with notable growth from games, eCommerce, education and Internet
services categories.
– Revenues from FinTech and Business Services grew by 4% year-on-year to RMB212.0 billion for the year ended

driven by robust growth in high-margin revenue streams from Domestic Games, Video Accounts, Weixin Search, and the Mini
Games platform. Improved profitability in our cloud services and long-form video businesses also contributed to the overall
increase in gross profit. Gross margin increased to 53%, compared to 48% in the prior year. The following table sets forth

10 Tencent Holdings Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses grew by 6% year-on-year to RMB36.4 billion for the year
ended 31 December 2024, reflecting higher promotional and advertising efforts to support new content releases. As a
percentage of revenues, selling and marketing expenses remained largely stable at 6%, consistent with the previous year.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 9% year-on-year to RMB112.7 billion
for the year ended 31 December 2024. This increase was primarily driven by higher R&D expenses, including those related
to our AI initiatives, alongside higher staff costs. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses remained
broadly stable at 17%, in line with the prior year.
Interest income. Interest income increased by 16% year-on-year to RMB16.0 billion for the year ended 31 December 2024
due to growth in cash reserves.
Finance costs . Finance costs decreased by 2% year-on-year to RMB12.0 billion for the year ended 31 December 2024,
primarily due to recognition of foreign exchange gains this year versus losses in the previous year, partially offset by higher
interest expenses.
Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures, net. We recorded share of profits of associates and joint ventures of
RMB25.2 billion for the year ended 31 December 2024, up from share of profits of RMB5.8 billion for the previous year. Non-IFRS
share of profits of associates and joint ventures rose to RMB31.6 billion, compared to RMB13.0 billion for the previous year.
The increase in non-IFRS share of profits of associates and joint ventures reflected stronger financial performances across
several associates, driven by company-specific factors, including business growth, new content releases and operational
efficiency improvements.
Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 4% year-on-year to RMB45.0 billion for the year ended 31 December
2024, primarily due to our operating profit growth, partially offset by the high base effect from deferred tax adjustments at an
overseas subsidiary in the previous year. Excluding the deferred tax adjustments in the prior year, income tax expense would
have increased by 15% year-on-year.
Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 68%
year-on-year to RMB194.1 billion for the year ended 31 December 2024. Non-IFRS profit attributable to equity holders of the
Company increased by 41% to RMB222.7 billion for the year ended 31 December 2024.

NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain additional non-IFRS financial
measures (in terms of operating profit, operating margin, profit for the period, profit attributable to equity holders of the
Company, basic EPS and diluted EPS) have been presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-IFRS financial
measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Group’s financial performance prepared

The Company’s management believes that the non-IFRS financial measures provide investors with useful supplementary
information to assess the performance of the Group’s core operations by excluding certain non-cash items and certain impact
of investment-related transactions. In addition, non-IFRS adjustments include relevant non-IFRS adjustments for the Group’s
major associates based on available published financials of the relevant major associates, or estimates made by the Company’s

Net cash 76,798 95,462
As at 31 December 2024, the Group had net cash of RMB76.8 billion, compared to net cash of RMB95.5 billion as at
30 September 2024. The sequential decline in net cash was primarily due to cash outflows related to capital expenditures and
share repurchases, as well as seasonally lower games gross receipts.
For the fourth quarter of 2024, the Group generated free cash flow of RMB4.5 billion. This was a result of net cash flow
generated from operating activities of RMB54.0 billion, offset by payments for capital expenditures of RMB39.0 billion to
support the development of our AI initiatives, as well as payments for media content of RMB8.5 billion and payments for lease
liabilities of RMB2.0 billion.
As at 31 December 2024, bank balances and cash of the Group were mainly denominated in RMB and primarily held by
subsidiaries in the Mainland of China whose functional currencies are RMB. The Group considers that any reasonable
changes in foreign exchange rates of currencies against major functional currencies would not result in a significant change
in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than
the respective subsidiaries’ functional currencies are considered to be not significant. Details are set out in Note 4.1 to the
consolidated financial statements.
